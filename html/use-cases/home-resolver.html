<h1>Resolver for Home Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#resolver-for-home-networks" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h1>
<p>To start off, let's ask the all-important question &quot;Why would you want Unbound
as a resolver for your home network?&quot;</p>
<p>Firstly, Unbound supports DNSSEC which, through an authentication chain,
verifies that the DNS query responses you receive are unaltered, as opposed to
query responses which are not DNSSEC-signed and could be changed by anyone who
has access to the query. Secondly, by using your own resolver you stop sharing
your DNS traffic with third parties and increase your DNS privacy. While you
still send out (parts of) your queries unencrypted, you could configure Unbound
to take it a step further, which we'll talk about in an upcoming guide. Lastly,
when you run your own resolver your DNS cache will be local to your network.
Even though the first time you resolve a domain name may be slightly slower than
using your ISP’s resolver, all subsequent queries for the name will likely be
much faster.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we'll look at setting up Unbound as a DNS resolver; First for
your own machine, and then for your entire network.</p>
<section id="setting-up-unbound">
<h2>Setting up Unbound<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-unbound" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unbound is a powerful validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It’s used by
some of the biggest tech companies in the world as well as small-office /
home-office users, who use it together with ad blockers and firewalls, or
self-hosted resolvers. Setting it up for your home network can be quite simple
as we’ll showcase below.</p>
<p>Setting up a caching DNS server for your entire home network requires a
recursive DNS resolver, and a dedicated machine on which the resolver runs; this
(small) system is always on and accessible to the entire network. It can be as
small as a Raspberry Pi or any other available Linux/Unix machine that is always
online and has Internet connectivity via your router.</p>
<p>Because of the variety of machines that Unbound can run on we cannot create a
comprehensive tutorial for all possible options. For this tutorial we will use
<strong>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</strong> as a stepping stone you can adapt and apply to
other systems.</p>
<p>While you could download the code from GitHub and build it yourself, getting a
copy can be as simple as running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>update
sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>unbound<span class="w"> </span>-y
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gives you a complete and running version of Unbound which behaves as a
caching recursive DNS resolver out of the box for the system on which you
install it. You can check which version of Unbound you have installed with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unbound</span> <span class="pre">-V</span></code>. The version installed will vary depending on the operating
system. If the version is installed is quite old (at the time of writing it
isn't) or you'd simply like to run the latest and greatest version you can
download the latest release tarball from our <a class="reference external" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">website</a> and build it yourself.</p>
<p>Do note that by default Unbound will be queriable only from the local host,
i.e. the system on which you installed Unbound.
We will change that later.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-the-resolver-locally">
<h2>Testing the resolver locally<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-resolver-locally" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>To verify that the server works correctly, it’s a good idea to test it before
committing the entire network to it. Luckily we can test this on the machine
that you installed Unbound on (locally) and from any other machine (remotely)
that will be using the resolver after we expose Unbound to the network.</p>
<p>The command for testing locally on the Unbound machine is:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dig<span class="w"> </span>example.com<span class="w"> </span>@127.0.0.1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here we tell the <strong class="command">dig</strong> tool to look up the IP address for example.com,
and to ask for this information from the resolver running at the IP address
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1</span></code>, which is where our Unbound machine is running by default. We can
verify that Unbound has indeed answered our query instead of the default
resolver that is present on Ubuntu by default. In the output of every
<strong class="command">dig</strong> command there is an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ANSWER</span> <span class="pre">SECTION</span></code> which gives the response
to the query. In the footer section of the output, the server which has answered
the query under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SERVER</span></code> entry. The entry will look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the next section we will be disabling the default Ubuntu resolver. To verify
that we do it correctly it is useful to know the address of the default resolver
as a baseline. For this baseline we also use a <strong class="command">dig</strong> query, but this
time without specifying an IP address (which causes dig to use the machine's
default DNS resolver).</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dig<span class="w"> </span>example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While the response should be the same, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SERVER</span></code> entry in the response
should look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>;; SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the final IPv4 digit is 53 and not 1, as with our Unbound instance.</p>
</section>
<section id="setting-up-for-a-single-machine">
<h2>Setting up for a single machine<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-for-a-single-machine" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have tested our Unbound resolver, we can tell our machine to use it
by default. The resolver your machine uses by default is defined in
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/systemd/resolved.conf</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DNS</span></code> entry (It uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.53</span></code>
). While just changing this file will work as long as the machine doesn't
reboot, we need to make sure that this change is persistent. To do that, we need
to change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DNS</span></code> entry to be equal to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1</span></code> so the machine uses
Unbound as default. To make the change persistent, we also need to set the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DNSStubListener</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no</span></code> so that is not changed by our router (such as with
a &quot;recommended resolver&quot; mentioned below). We also want to enable the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DNSSEC</span></code>
option so that we can verify the integrity the responses we get to our DNS
queries. With your favourite text editor (e.g. <strong class="command">nano</strong>) we can modify
the file:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nano<span class="w"> </span>/etc/systemd/resolved.conf
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Resolve]</span></code> section we add (or rather, enable by removing the
&quot;#&quot;) the options:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
#FallbackDNS=
#Domains=
DNSSEC=yes
#DNSOverTLS=no
#MulticastDNS=no
#LLMNR=no
#Cache=no-negative
DNSStubListener=no
#DNSStubListenerExtra=
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To actually have the system start using Unbound, we then need to create a symlink to overwrite <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/resolv.conf</span></code> to the one we modified.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ln<span class="w"> </span>-fs<span class="w"> </span>/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf<span class="w"> </span>/etc/resolv.conf
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this file modified, we can restart using this configuration with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>systemctl<span class="w"> </span>restart<span class="w"> </span>systemd-resolved
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If successful, the operating system should use our Unbound instance as default.
A quick test a <strong class="command">dig</strong> without specifying the address of the Unbound
server should give the same result as specifying it did above (with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;127.0.0.1</span></code>).</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dig<span class="w"> </span>example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the &quot;SERVER&quot; section in the output from <strong class="command">dig</strong> should also
contain the local IP address of our server.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)
</pre></div>
</div>

<section id="setting-up-for-the-rest-of-the-network">
<h2>Setting up for the rest of the network<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-for-the-rest-of-the-network" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>While we currently have a working instance of Unbound, we need it to be
reachable from within our entire network. With that comes the headache of
dealing with (local) IP addresses. It’s likely that your home router distributed
local IP addresses to your devices. If this is the case (i.e. you didn't change
it by hand), they should be <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918.html"><strong>RFC 1918</strong></a> ranges:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To find the IP address of the machine that is running Unbound, we use:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>hostname<span class="w"> </span>--all-ip-addresses
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you just have one IP address as output from the <strong class="command">hostname</strong> command
that will be the correct one. If you have multiple IP addresses, the easiest way
to determine which IP address to use, is to find out which connection goes to
your home router. Keep in mind that using the wrong IP address here can be a
source of connectivity errors further on. For the purpose of this tutorial we
assume that our home router has the IP address <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.1</span></code>, as this is
typical for home routers, and our resolver machine (the machine that is running
our Unbound instance) has IP address <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.2</span></code>, which we will get into in
the next section.</p>
<p>As a prerequisite for the next step, we need to configure our Unbound instance
to be reachable from devices other than only the machine on which the Unbound is
running.
Unbound is a highly capable resolver, and as such has many options which can be
set; the full example configuration file is almost 1200 lines long, but we'll
need but a fraction of these settings.
(If you are interested, all configuration options are documented in the
extensive manual page of <a class="reference internal" href="../manpages/unbound.conf.html"><span class="doc">unbound.conf(5)</span></a>).</p>
<p>The default configuration file is found at:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you open this for the first time it looks very empty. It is still usable as a
resolver for one machine, as this is how the Unbound defaults are configured.
It's not, however, enough for our purposes, so we will add the minimal
configuration options needed.</p>
<p>The options that we add to the current configuration file to make it a &quot;minimal
usable configuration&quot; are as follows.
Note that the IPv6 options are commented out, but we recommend to uncomment
them if your router and network supports it.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>server:
    # location of the trust anchor file that enables DNSSEC
    auto-trust-anchor-file: &quot;/var/lib/unbound/root.key&quot;
    # send minimal amount of information to upstream servers to enhance privacy
    qname-minimisation: yes
    # the interface that is used to connect to the network (this will listen to all interfaces)
    interface: 0.0.0.0
    # interface: ::0
    # addresses from the IP range that are allowed to connect to the resolver
    access-control: 192.168.0.0/16 allow
    # access-control: 2001:DB8/64 allow

remote-control:
    # allows controling unbound using &quot;unbound-control&quot;
    control-enable: yes
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The interface is currently configured to listen to any address on the machine,
and the access-control only allows queries from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.0/16</span></code> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing">IP
subnet</a>
range. Note that the IP address we chose above (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.1</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.2</span></code>) fall within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.0/16</span></code> range.</p>
<p>To prepare our configuration we are going to modify the existing configuration in
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/unbound/unbound.conf</span></code>. If you open the file for the first time, you
see that there is already an “include” in there. The &quot;include&quot; enables us to do
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sidn.nl/en/modern-internet-standards/dnssec">DNSSEC</a>, which allows
Unbound to verify the source of the answers that it receives, as well as QNAME
minimisation. For convenience these configuration options have already been
added in the minimal configuration.
The configuration also includes the <a class="reference internal" href="../manpages/unbound.conf.html#unbound-conf-remote"><span class="std std-ref">remote-control:</span></a>
section in the configuration to enable controlling Unbound using the
<a class="reference internal" href="../manpages/unbound-control.html"><span class="doc">unbound-control(8)</span></a> command, which is useful if you want to
modify the configuration on the fly later on.</p>
<p>Using the text editor again, we can then add the minimal configuration shown
above, making any changes to the access control where needed.
When we've modified the configuration we check it for mistakes with the
<a class="reference internal" href="../manpages/unbound-checkconf.html"><span class="doc">unbound-checkconf(8)</span></a> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unbound-checkconf<span class="w"> </span>unbound.conf
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If this command reports no errors, we need to stop the currently running Unbound
instance and restart it with our new configuration. You can stop Unbound with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>pkill<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>unbound
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And you can restart Unbound with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unbound-control<span class="w"> </span>start
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>From this point on, we can <a class="reference internal" href="../manpages/unbound-control.html#unbound-control-commands-stop"><span class="std std-ref">stop</span></a>,

<h2>Testing the resolver from a remote machine<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-resolver-from-a-remote-machine" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>So now we have a DNS resolver which should be reachable from within the network.
To be able to verify that our resolver is working correctly, we want to test it
from another machine in the network. As mentioned above, this tutorial uses the
address <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.2</span></code> (not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1</span></code> as we saw earlier) as an example for
the machine running Unbound. Armed with the IP address we can send a query to
our DNS resolver from another machine which is within our home network. To do
this we use the same dig command, only we change the IP address where the query
is asked.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dig<span class="w"> </span>example.com<span class="w"> </span>@192.168.0.2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This should give the same result as above. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SERVER</span></code> entry in the footer
reflects from which server the response was received.</p>

<h2>Where it all comes together<a class="headerlink" href="#where-it-all-comes-together" title="この見出しへのパーマリンク">¶</a></h2>
<p>We should now have a functioning DNS resolver that is accessible to all machines
in our network (<strong>make sure you do before you continue</strong>).</p>
<p>The next step then is a little tricky as there are many options and variations
possible. We have a choice of which machines in our network will be using our
configured DNS resolver. This can range from a single machine to all the
machines that are connected. Since this tutorial cannot (and does not try to) be
comprehensive for the range of choices, we will look at some of the basic
examples which you can implement and expand on.</p>
<p>Most machines when they first connect to a network get a “recommended resolver”
from your router using <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>. To
change this, we need to log into the router. Earlier in this tutorial we assume
the home router was using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.1</span></code>, though in reality this can differ.
If this does differ, the unbound configuration needs to be changed as well.</p>
<p>To find the IP address of our home router, which is likely be under the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">default</span> <span class="pre">gateway</span></code> entry from:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ip<span class="w"> </span>route
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you've found the IP address of your home router, you can copy the address
to a web browser, which should give you access to the router configuration
portal. If you can't find the portal using this method, consult the manual or
the manufacturer's website. When you have access, you should change the DHCP
configuration to advertise the IP address of the machine running Unbound as the
default gateway. In the case of our example, that would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.2</span></code>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a machine that does not use a resolver that is
“recommended” by your router. This machine can be running its own resolver or be
connected to a different one altogether. If you want these machines to use the
Unbound resolver you set up, you need to change the configuration of the
machine.</p>
