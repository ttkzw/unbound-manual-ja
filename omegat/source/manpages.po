"Unbound is an implementation of a DNS resolver, that does caching and "
"DNSSEC validation. This is the library API, for using the ``-lunbound`` "
"library. The server daemon is described in "
":doc:`unbound(8)</manpages/unbound>`. The library works independent from "
"a running unbound server, and can be used to convert hostnames to ip "
"addresses, and back, and obtain other information from the DNS. The "
"library performs public-key validation of results with DNSSEC."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manpages/libunbound.rst:197
msgid ""
"The library uses a variable of type *struct ub_ctx* to keep context "
"between calls. The user must maintain it, creating it with "
"**ub_ctx_create** and deleting it with **ub_ctx_delete**. It can be "
"created and deleted at any time. Creating it anew removes any previous "
"configuration (such as trusted keys) and clears any cached results."

"The functions are thread-safe, and a context can be used in a threaded "
